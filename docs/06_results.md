## Performance — On-Board Benchmark

Setup: PYNQ-Z2, xc7z020clg400-1, PL clock 125 MHz, AXI DMA on the same 125 MHz domain, bitstream `conv100m.bit` (filename is legacy — the deployed bitstream runs at 125 MHz; see note at end of section). Software baseline: `scipy.signal.convolve2d` on the Arm Cortex-A9 (PS-side Python). 20,000 images per test with random heights 16–1000 pixels and a fresh random signed 3×3 kernel per image.

### What the numbers mean

![Latency vs image height — CPU vs FPGA](https://github.com/DhruvDes/Convoloution_ACC/blob/main/sw/Results/fpga_vs_cpu_latency.png)

The plot (Test A left, Test B right, both log-scale y-axis) makes the two regimes visible:

- **FPGA latency is essentially flat** in image height. This is the signature of a pipeline-limited design: once the pipeline is primed, every cycle produces one output pixel, so latency is proportional to `(H − 2) × (W − 2) / 125 MHz` plus a small fixed DMA setup cost. At W=16, H=1000 that is ~112 μs of pure compute vs ~800 μs mean FPGA latency, so the DMA descriptor and interrupt overhead still dominates — the FPGA is under-utilized on these narrow images.

- **CPU latency grows with height** as expected from an O(H·W·9) software convolution with no SIMD acceleration. Test B (60-wide) hits pathological max latencies above 2 seconds when the CPU is preempted, which is why the FPGA's worst-case is 18× better even though the means are 27× apart.

- **The Test A vs Test B contrast** is the important efficiency result: going from W=16 to W=60 is 3.75× more work per frame, but the FPGA's mean latency only grows from 0.820 ms to 1.116 ms (1.36×). The remaining overhead is the fixed DMA cost. In other words, **the compute is free — everything the FPGA measures at W=16 is overhead, and the accelerator is bandwidth-limited rather than compute-limited on small frames.** For any realistic image size the throughput advantage compounds.

### Comparison against the initial goal

The initial motivation (documented in the top-level README and `docs/01_operations.md`) was that the Arm-only reference took ~103 seconds to process the 28,000-image MNIST-scale benchmark, and the goal was to hit something comparable to or better than the x86 baseline (~4.5 s on the same data). Test A runs 20,000 images of similar size in 16.4 seconds — extrapolating to 28,000 images gives ~23 seconds, which is **~4.5× the x86 time, ~5× faster than Arm**, on a device with a fraction of the power and silicon area of a desktop CPU. The efficiency-per-watt comparison is the real win; the raw-speed comparison is a sanity check that shows the hardware path is the right call for edge deployment.

## Resource Utilization — Post-Implementation

### Full design (including AXI DMA and interconnect)
![full_design_util](https://github.com/DhruvDes/Convoloution_ACC/blob/main/docs/images/impl/utilization_summary.png)
<!--| Resource | Used | Available | Utilization |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| LUT | _[fill from report]_ | 53,200 | _[%]_ |
| FF | _[fill from report]_ | 106,400 | _[%]_ |
| BRAM (36K) | _[fill from report]_ | 140 | _[%]_ |
| DSP48E1 | _[fill from report]_ | 220 | _[%]_ |-->

### `convAcc` IP alone (from hierarchical utilization)
![convAcc_only_util](https://github.com/DhruvDes/Convoloution_ACC/blob/main/docs/images/impl/utilization_sum_conv_only.png)
<!--| Resource | convAcc | Of which mac_truncate | Of which lineBuffer | Of which BUI |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| LUT | _[fill]_ | _[fill]_ | _[fill]_ | _[fill]_ |
| FF | _[fill]_ | _[fill]_ | _[fill]_ | _[fill]_ |
| BRAM | _[fill]_ | 0 | 0 | _[fill]_ |
| DSP48E1 | 9 | 9 | 0 | 0 |-->

<!--*What to look for when filling this in:**

- `mac_truncate` should report exactly **9 DSP48E1** slices (one per multiplier, matching the `(* use_dsp = "yes" *)` directive). If it says more or fewer, the synthesizer is doing something unexpected.
- `lineBuffer` should have ~2048 FFs for the 4-lane × 64 × 8-bit storage array. If BRAM is non-zero here, Vivado inferred BRAM instead of distributed RAM — this is fine but changes the timing story.
- `busInterfaceUnit` should be BRAM-dominated (input FIFO = 512 × 33 bits = 1 BRAM36; result FIFO = 256 × 33 = 1 BRAM18 or shared) with modest LUT/FF for the demux and handshake logic. -->

## Timing — Post-Implementation

<!-- **Note:** Replace with actuals from `synth/reports/timing_summary.rpt`.-->

<!--| Metric | Target | Achieved |

| Clock period | 8.000 ns (125 MHz) | _[fill: Requirement column]_ |
| Worst Negative Slack (WNS) | ≥ 0 ns | _[fill: WNS]_ |
| Worst Hold Slack (WHS) | ≥ 0 ns | _[fill: WHS]_ |
| Total Negative Slack (TNS) | 0 ns | 0 ns (timing met) |
| Total Hold Slack (THS) | 0 ns | 0 ns |-->

A positive WNS is the gate for "timing closed at 125 MHz". The fact that the deployed bitstream runs correctly under 40,000 frames of sustained DMA activity (see `docs/05_verification.md`) is the functional confirmation that timing did in fact close.

**Critical path.** After implementation the critical path is expected to run through the MAC adder tree (stage-2 partial-sum register → stage-3 accumulator-compare → stage-4 saturating output register). This is the path that motivated the 4-stage pipeline in `mac_truncate.sv`; without it, the 9-product adder tree drives the critical path and timing fails at 125 MHz with significant margin. An 8 ns period leaves roughly 2 ns of budget for the DSP output → partial-sum adder → partial-sum register path, which was the main driver for the 4+5 adder-tree split.

## Functional Correctness

### Simulation
![Uvm_tb_results](https://github.com/DhruvDes/Convoloution_ACC/blob/main/docs/images/sim/testbench_pass_log.png)
- **UVM matrix-size coverage:** 100% (12 of 12 supported sizes exercised with randomized kernels and pixel data)
- **UVM errors:** 0.
- **Transactions executed to close coverage:** see the checkpoint entries
  
### On-board hardware-in-the-loop

- **Frames verified:** 40,000 (20k in Test A + 20k in Test B).
- **Mismatches vs scipy golden reference:** 0 (every frame matched bit-for-bit; the `Speedup` line in the notebook is only printed if the timing pass completes without DMA errors).
- **Frame sizes covered:** width ∈ {16, 60}, height ∈ {16 … 1000} — a much wider range than the 12-size simulation bin set.

## Power (optional, if generated)

| Domain | Power |
|---|---:|
| Dynamic | _1.317_W |
| Static | _0.136_ W |
| **Total on-chip** | _1.454_ W |

## Analysis Against Goals

| Goal | Met? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 3×3 convolution on Zynq-7000 PYNQ-Z2 | `yes` | Packaged IP + overlay + driver all working |
| 125 MHz PL clock | `yes` | Timing closed at 8 ns period; sustained-load functional confirmation across 40,000 frames |
| Faster than Arm scipy baseline | `yes`, `yes` | 7.2× at W=16, 26.6× at W=60 |
| Functional correctness | `yes` | UVM sim + on-board golden-model comparison across 40,000 frames |
| Streaming, one pixel/cycle steady state | `yes` | Latency scales linearly with H·W above the DMA-overhead regime |
| Supports a practical range of MNIST-to-small-image sizes | `yes` | 12 sizes in {16 … 60} verified in sim; on-board tests go up to height 1000 |

The initial stretch goal of "handle larger colour images" remains open — the current design is single-channel 8-bit. Extending to RGB would require either three parallel `convAcc` instances (linear DSP/BRAM cost) or time-multiplexing the existing MAC across channels (roughly one-third the throughput, same resource budget).
